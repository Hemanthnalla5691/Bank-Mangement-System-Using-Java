This Java application simulates a simple banking system where users can create bank accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and check their account balances. 
The application is organized into four main parts, each represented by a class.

     Amount: The amount of money involved in the transaction.
     Date: The date when the transaction took place.
   Functionality: It has a method that formats the transaction details into a readable string, making it easy to display.
 2. Account Class Purpose: This class represents a bank account.
     Key Features:
       Account Number: A unique identifier for the account.
       Account Holder Name: The name of the person who owns the account.

       Transactions: A list that records all deposits and withdrawals made from the account.
     Functionality:
       Deposit Method: Allows users to add money to their account. It checks if the amount is positive before adding it.

    It creates an instance of the Bank class to manage accounts.
    It uses a loop to display a menu to the user, allowing them to choose actions like creating an account, depositing money, withdrawing money, or checking their balance.
    The program continues to run until the user decides to exit.
How It All Works Together
 User Interaction: When the program runs, it shows a menu to the user. The user can select options to perform different banking operations.
 Creating Accounts: Users can create accounts by providing a unique account number and their name.
 Depositing and Withdrawing: Users can add money to their accounts or take money out, with checks in place to ensure they can only withdraw what they have.
 Viewing Balances and Transactions: Users can check their current balance and see a history of their transactions.
